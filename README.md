# Only Tasks

This is a to-do list and general note-taking application with a calendar that provides a visual indication of the priority levels and summed duration of tasks on a given day.

## Prerequisites

This app is built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript with a Ruby-on-Rails backend. You will need to have installed Ruby (we used 2.6.3) and Rails (6.0+).

## How to Install

fork both the frontend and backend repositories. In the backend, run “$rails s” (without quotes or $) to start the server. In the frontend, open the index.html in the browser of your choice.

## How to Use

From the landing page you can choose to either Sign Up or Log In to your account. From there you will be taken to your page with a form to submit new tasks, a list of all of your tasks, a calendar with a view of each day’s tasks, a today’s tasks view, and a section to write notes. You will have the ability to edit, create, and delete your tasks and notes from the page.
